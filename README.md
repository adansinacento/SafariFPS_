# SafariFPS_

Safari game. This was just a Demo I made for a class, but given that I am using models I do not own I decided to make the code public.

*Usage:*     
-Move with WASD or arrow keys    
-Change the view direction with the mouse (pretty much like every shooter game)    
-Use space key to activate or deactivate camera mode    
-In camera mode, use click to take a picture    
-You have limited photo ammo, when you efectivelly take a picture of a pokemon it will dissapear and give you a little more photo ammo to keep playing    
-Pokemon throw thigs at you when you are close, if one of those things hits you you loose some photo ammo    

At any point you can press the enter key to watch the photos you have taken.

There's a gimmick for finding shiny pokemon.
